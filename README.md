### Discord music bot
_______
Jazzbot is music bot for Discord written in C# on top of [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus/) library.  
I'm pretty sure nobody will host it for themself but if you want to do so - here are requirements for this bot to run.  
### Requirements
_______
1. [.NET Core 2.2.0 or better](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)
2. Java
3. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 
4. [Lavalink](https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink)  

Recommended platform is Windows.  
I'm pretty sure `Code First` method for Entity Framework will not work so you should create your database and tables first.
